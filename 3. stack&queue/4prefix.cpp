// Based  on the Queue ADT given in Figure 4.23 page 129, write function prefix to return the value of a prefix expression passed to the 
// function as an array of string. For example, 

// string x[] = {"+","3","-","5","4"};

// cout << prefix(x,5); //where 5 is the length of the array

// => the printed result is 4.

// Assume that the operator used on the prefix expression just is binary + or binary - and the prefix expression just includes 
// operators and numbers without any parentheses. The prefix expression is always correct.

// The prototype of the function is:

// int prefix(const string * L,int n);
